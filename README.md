# RAG_Basic
This is basic LLM which implements RAG

Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently used in various daily activities, and I am no exception. At times, I found myself wondering how these LLMs retrieve information and generate answers. After some research, I came across the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I would like to share my understanding of this in the simplest terms possible, and I am eager to hear the thoughts and insights of others as well.

To illustrate this, let's consider a conversation between two people. Person 1 asks, "What is the GDP of India?" Person 2, who has read general information about GDP, replies, "It's 8%." The issues with this response are:
The exact source of information is unclear.
The response may be inaccurate.

Now, imagine if Person 2: 
Understands the question.
Refers to reliable sources, such as official government reports (e.g. press releases, economic surveys)
Retrieves relevant information specific to the query.
Provides a detailed response like:
"In Q1 of 2024–25, India's Real GDP is estimated at ₹43.64 lakh crore, and Nominal GDP at ₹77.31 lakh crore, reflecting growth rates of 6.7% and 9.7%, respectively."

This approach ensures accuracy and transparency. Similarly, RAG works by retrieving information from trusted sources to generate precise, fact-based responses.
In a similar manner, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) works by retrieving relevant information from trusted sources to improve the accuracy of responses generated by language models.

Why use RAG?

LLMs are limited to the data they were trained on, which can lead to outdated or inaccurate responses. Sometimes, AI models can even produce "hallucinations," where they generate answers that sound reasonable but aren't correct. These errors can happen due to insufficient training data, wrong assumptions, or biases in the data.
For instance, an AI model trained to detect cancer from medical images might misidentify healthy tissue as cancerous if it wasn't trained with enough examples of healthy tissue.
RAG helps reduce these issues by ensuring that the model pulls from the most reliable and up-to-date sources.

#Crux of the Story: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)#

RAG is a technique that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allowing them to access and incorporate relevant information from external sources. This approach significantly improves the accuracy, relevance, and factual correctness of the generated responses.

>Key Points:

Problem with Traditional LLMs: Traditional LLMs rely solely on the data they were trained on, which can lead to limitations, inaccuracies, and hallucinations.

How RAG Works: RAG addresses these limitations by:

Retrieving Relevant Information: Using a vector database to store and search through large amounts of text data.

Combining Information with Prompts: Incorporating the retrieved information into prompts for the LLM.

Generating Improved Responses: The LLM generates more accurate and informative responses based on the enriched prompts.

>Benefits of RAG:

Enhanced Accuracy: By leveraging external information, RAG reduces the likelihood of errors and hallucinations.

Improved Relevance: RAG ensures that the generated responses are highly relevant to the user's query.

Increased Factual Correctness: By incorporating factual information from reliable sources, RAG provides more trustworthy responses.


>Implementation Steps:

Vector Database Creation: Create a vector database to store embeddings of the data.

Retrieval Chain: Implement a retrieval chain to identify relevant documents based on user queries.

Question-Answer Chain: Create a question-answer chain to generate responses based on the retrieved documents.

RAG Chain Integration: Combine the retrieval and question-answer chains to form a complete RAG system.

By following these steps and leveraging the power of RAG, you can build more sophisticated and reliable AI applications that can provide accurate and informative responses to user queries.
